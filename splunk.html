    <h2>üîç Splunk Integration & SIEM Testing</h2>
    <p>
      In this lab, I integrated Splunk into my home network to simulate a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. Splunk was used to collect, index, and analyze log data from both Windows Server and Windows 10 endpoints within my Active Directory environment.
    </p>

    <h3>Splunk Installation and Setup</h3>
    <p>
      I installed Splunk Enterprise on the domain controller machine and configured the Universal Forwarder to capture log data since the DC is the targeted machine in this simulation. 
      The forwarders were set up to send Windows Event Logs (Security, System, Application) and PowerShell transcripts to the Splunk server over port 9997, as well as a custom index <code>ad_index</code> for AD specific events.
    </p>

    <h3>Log Sources and Ingestion</h3>
    <p>
      Key log sources included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Security logs (Event ID 4625 - failed logon attempts)</li>
      <li>PowerShell logs (command line auditing and execution)</li>
      <li>System logs related to reboots, service changes, and user logins</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I tested the ingestion by performing failed logons and account lockouts and searching the event logs for Event ID 4625.
    </p>

    <h3>Dashboards and Detection Queries</h3>
    <p>
      I created basic dashboards to visualize authentication failures, suspicious PowerShell use, and machine activity over time. Sample SPL (Search Processing Language) queries were used to detect brute-force activity, user enumeration, and privilege escalation attempts.
    </p>

    <h3>Skills Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Splunk Enterprise installation and forwarder configuration</li>
      <li>Windows log collection via Universal Forwarder</li>
      <li>SPL queries for threat detection</li>
      <li>Creating dashboards and alert logic</li>
      <li>Analyzing and interpreting Windows Event Log data</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges Encountered</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial connectivity issues due to incorrect receiving port settings on the Splunk indexer</li>
      <li>Forwarders failing to send logs until service restarts and permissions were adjusted</li>
      <li>Understanding and filtering relevant Windows Event IDs for detection use cases</li>
    </ul>
